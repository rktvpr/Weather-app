# Weather-app

## Description
This is a Weather Tracking Application with the purpose of showing you the weather for a specific
city/township. I used the Open Weather API to get my information and daily updates. There is a current day and a 5 day forecast to view. It has a history function to be able to go back to the previous searches you have made with one simple click.
## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed

WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
