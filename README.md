# Weather-app

## Description
This is a Weather Tracking Application with the purpose of showing you the weather for a specific
city/township. I used the Open Weather API to get my information and daily updates. There is a current day and a 5 day forecast to view. It has a history function to be able to go back to the previous searches you have made with one simple click. Building this app helped me learn about server side APIs and how to implement them into a functioning webpage

## Instructions

To use this application, 
input a location of your choice into the search bar,
click the history items to navigate to your previous searches,
click clear history to wipe the page of your previous searches.
